# 2048-Game-Using-C-
This project is an implementation of the popular single-player sliding tile puzzle game "2048". The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. The project uses C++ for the core logic and the console for user interaction.
